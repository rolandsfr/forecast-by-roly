# Forecast by Roly
Purely frontend oriented react weather app that is based on OpenWeather API  

## About the project
One of my first porjects I've ever built using react.
I did not use any state management libraries at the time so I used prop drilling and React Context API.
Sensitive data is hidden using Netlify lambda functions.
